# Run the program with gdb
# We see argv[1] is a number and its converted with atoi then it will be compared to another number
# So we will just check the compared number

objdump -D ./level0 | less
> /main

# We can se the cmp statement after the atoi call. It's 0x1ac so 423.

So we start the program with this number
./level0 423
> cat /home/user/level1/.pass
